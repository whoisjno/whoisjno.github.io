Nosek et al. (2014) recommended the following scoring algorithm:
- Remove trials >10000 ms (the cleanIAT function does that)
- Remove 1st four trials of response block (we already have done that when removing the _practice cond)
- Retain error trials
- Recore <400ms to 400ms and >2000ms to 2000ms (we'll do that)
- Compute D separately for each pair of two consectuive blocks separately, and then average
- Removes tasks with >10% fast responses

```{r}
iat.raw$trial.latency <- ifelse(iat.raw$rt<400, 400,
                                ifelse(iat.raw$rt>2000, 2000, iat.raw$rt))
min(iat.raw$trial.latency)
max(iat.raw$trial.latency)
```

Separate the four pairs of blocks to two datasets, in order to use the cleanIAT function (I believe this will provide what we need, but I haven't tested that thoroughly).
```{r}
#The combination of compatibility condition and block number determined the blockName for the scoring function.
iat.raw$blockName <- ifelse(iat.raw$cong == 'cong',
                            ifelse(iat.raw$block %in% c(2,3,6,7), 'B3',
                                   ifelse(iat.raw$block %in% c(4,5,8,9), 'B4', NA)),
