## Trials per Block

Number of trials per block should be guided by the number of exemplars.

> "There are typically between four and six items in each of the four categories. The number of trials in a block is often adjusted to allow each  of the stimuli to appear equally often."
> "With the same number of exemplars (n) for each of the four categories, this can be done in the two- category blocks (1, 2, and 5) by having trial counts that are integer multiples of 2n, and in the combined-task blocks (3, 4, 6, and 7) trial counts being an integer multiple of 4n."
> "With five items per category, the numbers might be as shown in the seven-block listing above. With four items per category, the numbers of trials in the seven blocks might by 16, 16, 32, 48, 24, 32, 48. For six items per category, these numbers might be 12, 12, 24, 48, 24, 24, 48"
> "As one example, the numbers for four items per category might be set at 16, 16, 24, 40, 24, 24, 40. The number of appearances of each item in combined tasks can then be equated because the sum of trials in each combined-task’s pair of blocks is an integer multiple of 4n—e.g., for Blocks 3 and 4 the sum is 24+40 = 64 (= 4 × 4n). Other numbers of items per category, especially with different numbers of exemplars in attribute and target catego- ries, might require inappropriately large numbers of trials to maintain equal appearances of each exemplar for target and/or attribute categories. The strict equality need not be treated as essential"

### Trials per Block Examples

#### 4 Items/Exemplars per Category

In single blocks, there must be at least 2xn, where n =

Block 1         : 16 # 8 exemplars (n) x 2 (2n) = 16
Block 2         : 16 # 8 exemplars (n) x 2 (2n) = 16
Block 3 (comb)  : 24 # 16 exemplars (n) x 4 (4n) = 64
Block 4 (comb)  : 40 # 32 + 48 trials = 80 (n) x 4 (4n) = 64
Block 5         : 24
Block 6 (comb)  : 32
Block 7 (comb)  : 32

#### 5 Items/Exemplars per Category

Block 1         : 20
Block 2         : 20
Block 3 (comb)  : 20
Block 4 (comb)  : 40
Block 5         : 30
Block 6 (comb)  : 20
Block 7 (comb)  : 40

#### 6 Items/Exemplars per Category

number of exemplars (n) = 6
inter multiple of 2n = 12, 24, 36, 48
inter multiple of 4n = 24, 48, 54, 96


2 category blocks
  2 x 6 = 12
  block 1: 12
  block 2: 12
  block 5: 24
   trials: 48
4 (combined) category blocks
  4 x 24 = 96
  block 3: 24
  block 4: 48
  block 6: 24
  block 7: 48
   trials: 48
Total trials = 144

Block 1         : 12
Block 2         : 12
Block 3 (comb)  : 24
Block 4 (comb)  : 48
Block 5         : 24
Block 6 (comb)  : 24
Block 7 (comb)  : 48
